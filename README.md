# Imaginatory Mod
Imaginatory is a mod that aims to add imaginatory content to Balatro. The main focus of the mod right now is adding new transforming playing cards to the game. There are 2 as of right now, with aims to add many more, along with Jokers to synergize.

## Prerequisites
This mod is made with the newest version of [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded). It is important to use the *newest* version of Steamodded and not the release version, which is very old.
1.0.0~ALPHA-1313a-STEAMODDED is the minimum requirement.

## Installation
1. Download the zip file with the contents of the repository. (Code -> Download Zip)\
2. Create a folder named ImaginatoryMod inside your mods folder.
3. Extract the zip file into the mods folder. Make sure that there is a single folder between the mods folder and the contents. (Mods\ImaginatoryMod\contents)
4. Launch Balatro!
